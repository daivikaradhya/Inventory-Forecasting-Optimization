# Inventory Forecasting & Reorder Optimization

This project uses machine learning and business intelligence to optimize inventory management by forecasting product-level demand and calculating reorder points with safety stock logic.

## Objective
To reduce stockouts and overstocking by forecasting demand and recommending dynamic reorder points using sales data.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, Prophet, NumPy)
- Power BI (visualization)
- Excel (reporting)
- Forecasting method: Prophet (time series)
- Inventory logic: ROP + Safety Stock (z = 1.65, 95% service level)

## Features
- Forecasted monthly demand for 24 products
- Reorder point and safety stock calculation
- Power BI dashboard with visualizations
- Reorder alert flags for decision-making

## Outputs
- Forecast + reorder report (Excel)
- Power BI dashboard (.pbix)
- Case study PDF (1 page)
- GitHub-hosted (complete project)

## Key Results
- 24 products analyzed with <40% MAPE
- Forecast model improved stock planning accuracy
- Enabled cost-saving decisions via smart inventory policies
